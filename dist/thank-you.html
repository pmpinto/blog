<p>Themes get better when people contribute. That is how our <a href="https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv" target="_blank">Online CV</a> got more than 250 likes. I would like to ask users to suggest changes and if possible create a pull-request.</p>

<p>You can still do it if you haven’t yet,</p>
