    <p>You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

    <h2>
        <a href="/blog/thank-you">Thanks for those 100 stars!</a>
    </h2>
    <p>I’m glad that you guys have liked and supported the theme to reach 100 stars on Github. I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and recommending it.

    </h2>
    <p>Hagura is a Kannada word for light-weight. The theme is very light and has very little CSS. The theme has very legible font style and distraction free layout.

    <h2>
        <a href="/blog/all-text">A sample post</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.
