Back from when I was at [Doist](https://doist.com), I got 2 boxes full of both [Todoist](https://todoist.com) and [Twist](https://twist.com) gift cards. The point of this was so that we could give them away to friends and family.

My family is not really into productivity software, let's face it. So I gave a few away to some friends that would actually made good use of them.

But I still have **dozens** of cards stacked up in a drawer, that I have no idea what to do with them. So I figured I could give them away to some of you that might be going through a hard time right now and might find that either Todoist or Twist (or even both!) could help you in any way during this time.

# Todoist

I'm currently holding **18/20** Todoist gift cards for this giveaway.  
Each of them will give you **1 free year** of Todoist Premium on the account you redeem it.


# Twist

I'm currently holding **8/10** Twist gift cards for this giveaway.  
Each of them will give you **$200 in Twist credit**, which you will be able to use in your account.

# How to get them

Head over to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmpinto) and send me a DM mentioning which gift cards you would like. I'll hand write your handle on it (I'll do my best, I promise), take a photo and send it your way.

This is not a contest, and they will be given out on a first come, first served basis.
Each gift card contains a gift code and instructions on where to redeem it. You can only apply 1 gift code per account, so ask around if you got any friends that need one because you surely won't be able to benefit from more than one.
