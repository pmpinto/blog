Ever since I started to work, I felt like there were little things I would like to share and ramble about. A few years later I even stumbled upon a Medium article that got me into a life-changing experience. I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to share the whole experience so that someone else could benefit from the same I had benefited by reading that article.

But I never got to create a blog of my ownâ€¦

I had used Medium before. But it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I wanted more control over the content and styles.

I had also used WordPress before. In a completely different context, but again, not exactly what I wanted. There's just too much in WordPress that I would never benefit from, and don't need.

One day, I found out about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and with it, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to create my own blog, with as much control as I ever wanted. But of course, as a former designer that I am, I jumped into sketching out how I wanted it to look like, in detail.

Needless to say, I wasted countless hours on it and never got to release anything.

I was missing the point altogether! Yes, I do like to design for the web. But the goal was for me to find some time to write a place for it, not to design.

Fast forward a few months and I found myself in the need of a place to lay some thoughts down. That's good, because it validates my previous wishes as a real need. But on the other hand, I was still missing that perfect place.

I decided I would go for the most simple implementation possible for two main reasons: it's faster to implement, and it puts the focus in the content, where it should be.

Along the way, I got to create this Jekyll theme called Mero which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/pmpinto/jekyll-mero).

Mero is a portuguese word for genuine and simple. And that's exactly what I wanted this theme [and blog] to be. Hopefully it inspires you to create that one thing you've been wanting to do for quite some time.
