                Ever since I started to work, I felt like there were little
                things I would like to share and ramble about. A few years later
                I even stumbled upon a Medium article that got me into a
                life-changing experience. I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to
                share the whole experience so that someone else could benefit
                from the same I had benefited by reading that article.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text about__text--lead">
                But I never got to create a blog of my ownâ€¦
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                I had used Medium before. But it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I
                wanted more control over the content and styles.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                I had also used WordPress before. In a completely different
                context, but again, not exactly what I wanted. There's just too
                much in WordPress that I would never benefit from, and don't
                need.

                Until one day, I found
                <a
                    href="https://pages.github.com/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    class="about__link"
                    >GitHub Pages</a
                >, and with it
                <a
                    href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    class="about__link"
                    >Jekyll</a
                >. This seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to create my
                own blog, with as much control as I ever wanted. But of course,
                as a former designer that I am, I jumped into sketching out how
                I wanted it to look, in detail.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text about__text--lead">
                Needless to say, I wasted countless hours on it and never got to
                release anything.

            <p class="about__text">
                I was missing the point altogether! Yes, I do like to design for
                the web. But the goal was for me to find some time to write, not
                to design.

                Fast forward a few months and I found myself in the need of a
                place to lay some thoughts down. That's good, because it
                validates my previous wishes as a real need. But on the other
                hand, I was still missing that perfect place.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
                I decided I would go for the most simple implementation possible
                for two main reasons: it's faster to implement, and it puts the
                focus in the content, where it should be.

                Along the way, I got to create this Jekyll theme called Mero
                which you can find

                Mero is a portuguese word for genuine and simple. And that
                exactly what I wanted this blog/theme to be. Hopefully you get
                inspired to create your own stuff as well.
