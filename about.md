I'm [Pedro Pinto](https://pedropinto.me/), a Front-end Developer from Portugal, with a love for aesthetics and separation of concerns.

Ever since I started to work, I felt like there were little things I would like to share and ramble about. A few years later I even stumbled upon a Medium article that got me into a life-changing experience. I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to share the whole experience so that someone else could benefit from the same I had benefited by reading that article.

But I never got to create a blog of my ownâ€¦

I had used Medium before. But it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I wanted more control over the content and styles.

I had also used WordPress before. In a completely different context, but again, not exactly what I wanted. There's just too much in WordPress that I would never benefit from, and don't need.

Until one day, I found [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and with it [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to create my own blog, with as much control as I ever wanted. But of course, as a former designer that I am, I jumped into sketching out how I wanted it to look, in detail.

Needless to say, I wasted countless hours on it and never got to release anything.

I was missing the point altogether! Yes, I do like to design for the web. But the goal was for me to find some time to write, not to design.

Fast forward a few months and I found myself in the need of a place to lay some thoughts down. That's good, because it validates my previous wishes as a real need. But on the other hand, I was still missing that perfect place.

I decided I would go for the most simple implementation possible for two main reasons: it's faster to implement, and it puts the focus in the content, where it should be.

Along the way, I got to create this Jekyll theme called Mero which you can get [here](https://github.com/pmpinto/jekyll-mero).

Mero is a portuguese word for genuine and simple. And that's exactly what I wanted this theme to be. Hopefully it inspires you to create that one thing you've been wanting to do for quite some time.

You may also find me throughout the interwebs on [GitHub](https://github.com/pmpinto) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmpinto).

<sup class="about__muted">1</sup> Fun fact: This is exactly how I got described during a job interview, by the recruiter.
